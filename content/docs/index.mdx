### Component Registry
Billing SDK uses a sophisticated **[Component Registry](/docs/cli#component-registry)** system that allows for:
- Centralized component distribution
- Version management and updates
- Automated dependency resolution
- Consistent theming across all components

### Framework Integration
Seamless integration with modern frameworks:
- ✅ **Next.js** (App Router) - Full support with API routes and server actions
- 🚧 **Express.js** - Backend API integration (coming soon)
- 🚧 **Additional Frameworks** - Based on community demand

## AI-Ready Documentation

Billing SDK provides an **[LLMs-full.txt](https://billingsdk.com/llms-full.txt)** file that helps AI models understand how to interact with these components. This enables better AI-assisted development and automated code generation.

## Prerequisites
